# Quick Start

**@aptos-labs/react** is a collection of opinionated React hooks for building on top of Aptos. The library focuses on providing a seamless experience for developers to build with the best practices in mind.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
### Installation

To install Aptos JS-Pro with React hooks, you can use your preferred package manager.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aptos-labs/ts-sdk @aptos-labs/js-pro @tanstack/react-query @aptos-labs/react
```

**With Wallet Adapter (Recommended)**

For most use cases, you will want to install the `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` package to manage your wallet connections. In this guide, we will assume you are using the
wallet adapter.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react
```

### Setting up Providers

To utilize Aptos JS-Pro across your application, you will need to set up your providers in order to manage your network and account connections.

**`AptosWalletAdapterProvider` from `@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react` (Recommended)**

Begin by wrapping your application in the `AptosWalletAdapterProvider` component. This will provide your application with the necessary context to manage your wallet connections.

```tsx filename="App.tsx"
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import { AptosWalletAdapterProvider } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react";

export default function App({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return <AptosWalletAdapterProvider>{children}</AptosWalletAdapterProvider>;
}
```

**`QueryClientProvider` from `@tanstack/react-query`**

Next, wrap your application in the `QueryClientProvider` component from `@tanstack/react-query`. This will provide your application with the necessary context to manage your queries.

```tsx filename="App.tsx" {3-3, 5-5, 9-11}
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import { AptosWalletAdapterProvider } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export default function App({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <AptosWalletAdapterProvider>{children}</AptosWalletAdapterProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

**`AptosJSCoreProvider` from `@aptos-labs/react`**

The final step is to wrap your application in the `AptosJSCoreProvider` component from `@aptos-labs/react`. In order to do so, you will need to create a custom component
that takes the connection information from the `AptosWalletAdapterProvider` and passes it to the `AptosJSCoreProvider`.

```tsx filename="AptosCoreProvider.tsx"
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import { AptosJSCoreProvider } from "@aptos-labs/react";
import { useWalletAdapterCore } from "@aptos-labs/react/connectors";
import { useWallet } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react";

export default function AptosCoreProvider({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  const wallet = useWallet();

  const core = useWalletAdapterCore({ wallet });

  return <AptosJSCoreProvider core={core}>{children}</AptosJSCoreProvider>;
}
```

Once you have created the `AptosCoreProvider`, you can wrap your application with it.

```tsx filename="App.tsx" /AptosCoreProvider/
import { PropsWithChildren } from "react";
import { AptosWalletAdapterProvider } from "@aptos-labs/wallet-adapter-react";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { AptosCoreProvider } from "./AptosCoreProvider";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export default function App({ children }: PropsWithChildren) {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <AptosWalletAdapterProvider>
        <AptosCoreProvider>{children}</AptosCoreProvider>
      </AptosWalletAdapterProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

### Wallet Selector (recommended)

Once you have set up the providers, we also recommend adding a wallet selector UI to your application. A wallet selector is a component that allows a user to select their wallet of choice. Whenever a user connects their wallet,
the wallet adapter should automatically connect the wallet to your JS-Pro context.

You can follow this guide to setup a wallet selector for your application: [Using a Wallet Selector UI](<https://aptos.dev/en/build/sdks/wallet-adapter/dapp#import-usewallet-in-files-where-you-want-to-access-data-from-the-provider:~:text=%3D%20useWallet()%3B-,Choose%20a%20UI%20Package,-The%20Wallet%20Adapter>).

<div className="flex justify-center rounded-lg border overflow-clip">
  <a
    href="https://aptos.dev/en/build/sdks/wallet-adapter/dapp#import-usewallet-in-files-where-you-want-to-access-data-from-the-provider:~:text=%3D%20useWallet()%3B-,Choose%20a%20UI%20Package,-The%20Wallet%20Adapter"

  </a>
</div>

### You're all set!

Now that you have your providers set up, you can start using Aptos JS-Pro React hooks. With Aptos JS-Pro React, you gain access to a collection of
opinonated hooks that are reactive, tested, and ready to use out of the box. Create your first Aptos application in minutes!

**Querying the Blockchain**

The `useAptBalance` hook is a simple hook that queries the Aptos blockchain for the balance of an account.

```tsx filename="Home.tsx"
import { useAptBalance } from "@aptos-labs/react";

export default function Home() {
  const { data: aptBalance, isLoading } = useAptBalance();

  if (isLoading) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return <div>{aptBalance?.toString()}</div>;
}
```

**Signing and Submitting Transactions**

The `useSignAndSubmitTransaction` hook is a hook that signs and submits a transaction to the Aptos blockchain.

```tsx filename="Home.tsx"
import { useSignAndSubmitTransaction, parseApt } from "@aptos-labs/react";

function SendTransactionPage() {
  const { hash, signAndSubmitTransaction } = useSignAndSubmitTransaction();

  async function submit(e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = new FormData(e.target as HTMLFormElement);
    const address = formData.get("address") as `0x${string}`;
    const value = formData.get("value") as string;
    signAndSubmitTransaction({
      data: {
        function: `0x1::aptos_account::transfer`,
        functionArguments: [address, parseApt(amount)],
      },
    });
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={submit}>
      <input name="address" placeholder="0x1â€¦e918" required />
      <input name="value" placeholder="0.1" required />
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
      {hash && <div>Transaction Hash: {hash}</div>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
