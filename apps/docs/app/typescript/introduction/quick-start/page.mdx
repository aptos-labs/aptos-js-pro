# Quick Start

**@aptos-labs/js-pro** is a collection of TypeScript utilities for building on top of Aptos. The library focuses on providing a seamless experience for developers to build with the best practices in mind.

## Getting Started

<Steps>
### Installation

To install Aptos JS-Pro, you can use your preferred package manager.

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @aptos-labs/ts-sdk @aptos-labs/js-pro
```

### Creating a `AptosJSProClient`

To utilize Aptos JS-Pro in your application, you will need to create a `AptosJSProClient` in order to manage your networks and account connections.

```ts
import { AptosJSProClient } from "@aptos-labs/js-pro";
import { Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

const client = new AptosJSProClient({
  network: { network: Network.DEVNET },
});
```

The `AptosJSProClient` is a layer on top of the `@aptos-labs/ts-sdk` client. It provides a more opinionated interface for interacting with the Aptos blockchain and can be used to manage
your networks and account connections from a single source.

### Account Management

If there is an existing account you would like to plug into the client, you can do so by using the `convertAptosAccountToAccountInfo` and `convertAptosAccountToSigner` utilities.

```ts
import { AptosJSProClient } from "@aptos-labs/js-pro";
import { Network } from "@aptos-labs/ts-sdk";

const account = Account.generate();

const client = new AptosJSProClient({
  account: convertAptosAccountToAccountInfo(account),
  signer: convertAptosAccountToSigner(account),
  network: { network: Network.DEVNET },
});
```

By establishing the client with an account, the client will use the `signer` to sign and/or submit transactions. For example, if you were to call `client.signAndSubmitTransaction` without specifying a signer,
the client would use the `signer` from the client.

### You're all set!

Now that you have your client set up, you can start using Aptos JS-Pro. With Aptos JS-Pro, you gain access to a collection of
opinonated utilities that are reactive, tested, and ready to use out of the box. Create your first Aptos application in minutes!

**Querying the Blockchain**

The `fetchBalance` function is a simple function that queries the Aptos blockchain for the balance of an account.

```ts
const balance = await client.fetchBalance({
  address: "0x926ff619e85bdb5b02680f27bea5ea3302c71f86be4b16fa0d63df213add927a",
  asset: "0x1::AptosCoin::AptosCoin",
});
```

**Signing and Submitting Transactions**

The `signAndSubmitTransaction` function is a function that signs and submits a transaction to the Aptos blockchain.

```ts
import { parseApt } from "@aptos-labs/js-pro";

// Will sign and submit the transaction using the client's signer
const pendingTransaction = await client.signAndSubmitTransaction({
  data: {
    function: "0x1::aptos_coin::transfer",
    functionArguments: [
      "0x926ff619e85bdb5b02680f27bea5ea3302c71f86be4b16fa0d63df213add927a",
      parseApt(amount),
    ],
  },
});
```

**Switching Accounts or Networks**

If you need to switch the account or network, you can do so by calling the `setAccount` and `setNetwork` methods.

```ts
client.setAccount(convertAptosAccountToAccountInfo(account));
client.setNetwork({ network: Network.MAINNET });
```

These methods are reactive meaning that the client can be subscribed to the account and network changes.
